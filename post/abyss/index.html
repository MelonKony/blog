    <p><strong>Sometimes I just need a short-form space to put down some thoughts</strong>. This isn&rsquo;t really a public thing. I&rsquo;m not starting a newsletter. Most introspection is done introspectively. But sometimes it&rsquo;s just easier to write it out.</p>
<p>This week, I started waking up around 4:45am each day. It&rsquo;s a better way to live. Previously, Tzipora was a late-sleeper &ndash; I think, considering how much better it is living alongside the sun, it makes more sense if she&rsquo;s an early riser. She has that stern social conservatism about her, so it only makes sense.</p>
<p>Some notes to myself, while I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<ul>
<li>The comic is going pretty horribly. Not that it&rsquo;s coming out bad, just that it&rsquo;s not really coming out at all. Who knew it was so hard to do what people spend a lifetime doing?</li>
<li>I want to restart the <em>Atlantic Bulletin</em>. Properly, as a lengthy periodical. The project gets boring otherwise. A lot of people like the academic stuff, I&rsquo;m just not well-read enough to keep up.</li>
<li>I need to structure my days better. Actually, let&rsquo;s expand on that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had an atrocious time today trying to implement a &lsquo;reader view&rsquo; on the website. Actually, that&rsquo;s part of why I founded this blog. A whole day wasted with that, and I&rsquo;m already behind on both my job-hunting and regular illustrations. I don&rsquo;t even want to think about the comic.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t all bad. I had a parmie at the pub and cooked pasta for dinner. I also took the cat to the vet &ndash; she&rsquo;s doing well üê±. I feel pretty rubbish otherwise. That&rsquo;s all you can do to describe it really, and you still sound like a piece of shit saying it. There really is no way to write things down without sounding pathetically self-concerned. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to open each one of these with apologies.</p>
<p>I sent Captain V. <em>Shemozzle</em>&rsquo;s three albums. I love them, it reminds me of being a kid. I used to like the high-energy stuff that everyone would dance to down in Salamanca, but recently I&rsquo;ve been listening to <em>Yahoudi&rsquo;s Waltz</em>. I&rsquo;ll try and link that below.</p>

<p>Enjoy the song. See you around.</p>
